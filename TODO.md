## TODO
### Blocks
- Flag block
- Conditional blocks
- Slim versions of constant blocks
- Probe block

### Editor
- Categories for block spawning dropdown
- Make test runner more clear
- Show short description at top of editor (closeable/popup?)
- Make joints obvious
- Blocks can switch between "forms" in the same family (e.g.: add/sub/mult/div)
- Stretch goal: see generated code
- Test runner should be pinned to the UI and minimizable

### UI
- Make text/image modals

### Puzzles
- Constants block: defineable in puzzle file
- More easy puzzles

### Saves
- Loading saves loads puzzle states

### Main menu
- Seperate block face and pin direction for puzzle icons

### Info Panel
- Tabs
- Support images in descriptions
- Documentation tab
  - In service of this, I think every block should have a description -- generated from docstring?
- Progress bar; x/total completed, percentage, literal bar

### Lore
- Lore bible
- Styleguide for puzzle descriptions
- Styleguide for comms

### Audio
- We need more audio/sound design in general

### Bugs
- It is not clear when you've beaten a level
- People keep trying to "unplug" connections instead of right-clicking the line
- Temp variables don't reappear if block deleted
